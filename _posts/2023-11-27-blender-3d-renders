I had a basic HTML Github pages but decided it was time to upgrade. 
During this project I learned more about managing git repositories, Jekyll, and a little Ruby. 
Let's see how far I can customize this site for my needs! :)

If you're interested in how I made this free site check out: [Github Docs; Github Pages how to].

Also check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyllâ€™s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].
