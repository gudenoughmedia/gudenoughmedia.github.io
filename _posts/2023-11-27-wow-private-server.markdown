<p>About a decade ago when the Wrath of the Litch expansion released I had started up a private server on my very first computer. </p>
<p>I did not understand as much about computers/networking as I do now so I wanted to re-attempt. 
I found an opensource project called Azerothcore and started my project.
It turned out to be a great learning exercise utilizing MySQL, C-Make, VS Studio C++ compiling, docker, and proxy forwarding. </p>
The end result was a server I could run on my laptop and play from anywhere, even utilizing a forked branch of the main respository that has a module for simulating players using bots based off real player-data.
