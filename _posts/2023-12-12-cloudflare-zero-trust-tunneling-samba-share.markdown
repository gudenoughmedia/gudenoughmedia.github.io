<p>Did a quick project today to use cloudflare zero trust tunnels & warp client to access a samba share from outside my local network. <br> <br>
Used <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/use-cases/smb/">this</a> guide from Cloudflare Docs to accomplish this task as well as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ey4u7OUAF3c">this</a> youtube video from NetworkChuck as a basis for creating my own domain for future projects and routing more projects in the future.
